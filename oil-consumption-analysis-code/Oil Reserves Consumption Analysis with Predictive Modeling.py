# Oil Reserves and Consumption Analysis with Predictive Modeling

This project aims to analyze trends in oil consumption and reserves across various countries using data from 1965 to 2023. The main objective is to predict future oil consumption patterns, providing insights that could guide countries in their transition to sustainable energy. We developed multiple machine learning models to understand oil consumption patterns and assess the sustainability impact of these trends.

##The notebook is structured as follows:



1.   **Section 1: Problem Definition**
2.   **Section 2: Data Collection & Preparation & Feature Engineering**
3.   **Section 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
4.   **Section 4: Model Development & Evaluation**
5.   **Section 5: Results & Sustainability Impact**
6.   **Section 6: References & Documentation**

<br></br>
This project provides insights into the global shift in energy consumption and contributes to understanding the pressing need for sustainability in energy resources.

# Section 1: Problem Definition
---

###**Research Questions:**

1.   How can historical data be used to predict future trends in global oil consumption?

2.   How do oil reserves and consumption change over time, and what are the patterns that show a move toward cleaner energy?

3. From the dataset can we figure out which countries might have shifted to renewable energy?

###**Alignment with UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs):**

The project aligns with the following UN Sustainable Development Goals:




1. Goal 7: Affordable and Clean Energy

  *  This project contributes to Goal 7 by analyzing oil consumption trends, highlighting the need for a transition to renewable energy. It provides a predictive framework to help countries plan for more sustainable energy usage.


2. Goal 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

  * Understanding the dynamics of oil consumption and predicting future trends promotes responsible management of resources, encouraging countries to switch to sustainable production practices.

###**Problem Statement:**

The world is experiencing an ongoing transition from fossil fuels to more sustainable energy sources. However, it's challeging to determine when each country should start focusing hwaviky on renewable energy, specificly given the unpredictibility of oil consumption trends and reserves. this project address the issue by predicting oil consumbtion for each country providing insights on when to switch to cleaner energy sources.

###**Potential Impact:**



*   **Planning for Sustainable Energy:** Countries will be able to identify optimal times to transition from oil consumption to renewable energy, by making a plan to shift from a period of time that will not make the country rush and surprised by an oil shortage.
*   **Reduced Carbon Footprint:** Encouraging Countries to transfer from fossil fuel to renewable energy will contribute toward a reduced carbon footprint, and that aligns with climate action initiatives and promoting environmental sustainability.
*   **Economic Stability:** By predicting future oil consumption countries can make more informed decisions to mitigate risks related to energy price instability, and that will help to avoid sudden economic disruptions.

# Section 2: Data Collection & Preparation & Feature Engineering
---

In this section, feature engineering was done before EDA to prepare the data for effective analysis. The initial features were disorganized and not easily analyzable, requiring transformation and structuring into meaningful columns. This process helped eliminate inconsistencies, handle missing values, and create derived features, making the data more interpretable and ensuring EDA could provide accurate insights for further modeling.

##**Data Source Documentation:**



1.   **Dataset Name and Source:**
  *   Name: World Largest Oil Reserves & Consumption Dataset
  *   Source: [World Largest Oil Reserves & Consumption Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhammadroshaanriaz/oil-reserves-and-consumption-from-1995-to-2022)

2.   **Time period covered:**
  *   Oil Consumption: 1965 - 2023
  *   Oil Researves: 1995 - 2021

3.   **Number of records and Feature:**
  *   Number of records after Cleaning is about 6000 records
  *   The Features Available are:
      *   Year
      *   Country
      *   Oil Consumption (TWh)
      *   Oil Researves (Barrels)

4.   **Data Collection Methodology:**

  *   The dataset provider on Kaggle has aggregated information from national energy departments, international organizations, and industry reports, using standardized methodologies to ensure consistency and accuracy. These methodologies are used to make the dataset reliable for assessing trends in global oil reserves and consumption, and he says that the data is updated annually, providing a comprehensive foundation for research and analysis in energy economics and sustainability.

#Section 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

this secton involves exploring the data to underrstand its structure, pattern and trends. and this step will be divided into:



1.   Global Oil Consumption and Reserves Analysis (Line plots)
2.   Distribution of Oil Consumption and Reserves (Histograms and density plots)
3.   Box Plot Analysis of Oil Consumption and Reserves (Box plots)
4.   Oil Consumption Trends in Key Countries (Scatter plots, trend lines, and linear regression plots)
5.   Correlation Analysis Between Oil Consumption and Reserves (Heatmap and scatter plot)
6.   Descriptive Statistics for Oil Consumption and Reserves

##**Global Oil Consumption and Reserves Analysis**

The analysis explores trends in oil consumption and reserves from 1965-2023 and 1995-2021, respectively. Consumption shows a steady rise, with some fluctuations, while reserves have stabilized after significant growth between 2005 and 2010. This indicates a growing gap between consumption and supply. The findings underscore the importance of transitioning to sustainable energy sources.

* Data: Consumption (1965-2023), Reserves (1995-2021).
* Consumption rising; reserves steady.
* Potential future supply-demand gap.
* and Finally that highlights the need for sustainable energy.

"""#Section 5: Results & Sustainability Impact
---
To analyze the trend of oil consumption in Countries, three models were compared: Polynomial Regression (Degree 2), Ridge Regression, and Random Forest Regressor. Although the Random Forest Regressor had the highest R² score of 0.89 FOR Finland, overfitting was observed; thus, Polynomial Regression would be more appropriate to capture the general decline in oil consumption.

While the Polynomial Regression model indicated a sharp decline, most probably due to shifting towards alternative energy sources, the Ridge Regression suggested a gradual decline. This decline portends global sustainability through reduced emissions. Economically, this spells the need for diversification of energy, while socially, it underlines the need to embrace renewable alternatives. Due to dataset limitations, such as a lack of economic features, the analysis may not fully capture broader influences but still provides valuable insights for sustainability planning.

##**Required Components:**

###**Answering each research question with evidence**

1. How can historical data be used to predict future trends in global oil consumption?

  * Historical data gives the base for modeling and predicting future trends. Using various regression models, such as Polynomial Regression, Ridge Regression, and Random Forest Regressor, we analyzed oil consumption patterns over time. The Polynomial Regression model captured the overall trend of a decline in oil consumption in Finland, while Ridge Regression helped in estimating a more gradual decline. This historical data, once processed through machine learning models, can help us estimate the path of future consumption, considering trends, past usage patterns, and potential shifts.

2. How do oil reserves and consumption change over time, and what are the patterns that show a move toward cleaner energy?

  * Our analysis showed that oil consumption is generally on the decline, especially in countries like Finland. In fact, according to the Polynomial Regression model, the consumption has been falling considerably, which might indicate the shift towards cleaner energy resources. Moreover, the drop in oil consumption follows the global trend of shifting towards renewable energy resources as part of sustainability initiatives. While we do not have direct data on reserves or economic and policy factors, the observed reduction in oil use indicates, at the very least, efforts toward moving away from dependence on oil to cleaner, renewable energy solutions.


3. From the dataset, can we figure out which countries might have shifted to renewable energy?

  * The dataset has been provided with consumption trends; therefore, one may infer the decline as a shift into renewable energy. In this case, Finland has presented Polynomial Regression and Ridge Regression models that indicated either constant or sharp decline in its oil consumption. These continuous reductions may suggest a move in adopting renewable energy. However, given the very limited availability of economic, or renewable-specific features in the dataset, we are indeed limited in our ability to definitively identify countries that are shifting to renewable energy. The patterns we identified were indicative, but for concrete conclusions, further data would be required.

###**Quantify sustainability impact**

To quantify the sustainability impact of our findings, we focus on the following areas:


1. Reduction in Oil Consumption:
  * Our predictions suggests a great decline in oil consumption for countries like Finland by the year 2050; this may be indicative that there is, or may be, a transition into cleaner energy sources. Looking at the steep decline of polynomial regression, this could possibly mean that in the period under consideration, a movement away from fossil fuels is highly probable by about 80%.


2. Emissions Reduction:
  * With oil consumption projected to decline, there would be an expected decrease in carbon emissions, contributing significantly towards global emission reduction targets. With oil consumption projected to decline, there would be an expected decrease in carbon emissions, contributing significantly towards global emission reduction targets.

###**limitations**

Limitations included that the analysis could not make use of economic, social, and policy-related features in this dataset to better understand the driving factors of change in oil consumption. Only historical data regarding oil consumption and reserves were present in the dataset, with no greater context, such as economic growth, renewable energy adoption rates, or government energy policies. This restriction makes the models hardly predictive and hinders the differentiation of the trends observed, which may be due to either policy variations, market forces, or other causes. Finally, the data set lacks the detailed adoption of renewable energy in specific countries. That is, we cannot tell exactly from the decrease in oil consumption if the shift to renewable energies has occurred or not.

###**Propose future improvements**

Future enhancements could be made to increase the dataset with further economic indicators, renewable energy adoption rates, and other influential factors such as government policies. With these features, a more detailed analysis would be possible, increasing the accuracy of the models and providing further insight into the transition toward sustainable energy. The predictive performance could also be further improved with more advanced machine learning models.

##**Impact Assessment:**

###**Environmental Impact**

A decrease in oil consumption directly translates to reduced greenhouse gas emissions, and that aid in the combat against climate change and improving air quality. Moving away from oil decreases the environmental risk due to drilling, transportation, and oil spills.

###**Social Impact**

Reduced oil consumption would mean improved air quality, resulting in a positive impact on public health. Encourages societies to adapt to renewable sources, creating awareness and job opportunities in the renewable energy sector.

###**Economic Impact**

A transition into renewable energy sources decreases dependency on oil, which has volatile market prices, and thus enhances economic stability. Investment in renewable energy infrastructure creates new avenues for the economy to diversify and grow.

###**SDG Alignment Evidence:**

* **Affordable and Clean Energy (SDG 7):** enabling the transition toward renewable energy in countries contributes to ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all.
* **Climate Action (SDG 13):** The findings will reduce emissions and help to combat climate change.
* **Decent Work and Economic Growth (SDG 8):** The transition to renewable energies will create employment opportunities and spur innovation.
